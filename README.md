# IMDB_SEARCH
This project made on python 2.7.9 helps in Web Scraping.
Here we get information of Most Popular TV Series (names,url,keywords,ratings etc.) in IMDB by parsing its HTML.
Finally we use the keywords to search for the tv-series.

final_pickle.py - this file saves the name and keywords of the tv series in a pickle.
imdb_search.py - this file helps to search for tv series by their keywords.
